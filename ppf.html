        <h2>Paint Protection Film</h2>
        <p>Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a transparent, durable polyurethane film applied to a vehicle's exterior 
            surfaces to protect the paint from damage caused by road debris, rock chips, scratches, and environmental 
            contaminants. Originally developed for military applications, PPF has evolved into a high-tech solution
             for preserving automotive paint. Known for its self-healing properties, PPF can recover from minor scratches
              with heat exposure, maintaining a smooth, glossy finish. Available in a variety of finishes—such as glossy
               or matte—PPF not only enhances a vehicle's appearance but also provides long-lasting protection, making it
                popular among car enthusiasts and daily drivers alike.
